<p>I wanted to write some stuff. And I want to do it easily.
So naturally, I needed a blog. But I&rsquo;m quite picky</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m keen to keep it free. If I have to pay even a tiny amount, then its likely per GB or request. That means I should probably have a CDN in front. The only free CDN I know of is cloudflare. That means giving them my DNS. My DNS hosts other things. I&rsquo;m also just cheap</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d like to minimize javascript. The more I have to write, the less likely any of my words see a single GET.</li>
<li>I need automated deployments.</li>
<li>I want to minimize ads.</li>
</ul>
<p>This leaves me with a static site. Static sites are great. The threat window is much smaller than traditional websites.
There is no database to maintain and it&rsquo;s very simple to add a CDN in front, making them very fast and scalable.</p>
<p>So I need a static site generator. There are lots of javascript ones, like , <a href=https://www.gatsbyjs.com/>gatsby</a>, <a href=https://nextjs.org/>next.js</a> and <a href=https://jekyllrb.com/>jekyll</a>.
None of them meet my requirements as I&rsquo;m not big on javascript.</p>
<p>I landed on <a href=https://gohugo.io/>hugo</a>. Its written in Go, that means its a single binary. phew. In 5 minutes I was writing this post.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of cloud services that can do object storage. AWS/GCP are pretty cheap, but not free.</p>
<p>I explored Catalyst Cloud, a NZ hosting provider. They currently offer $300 credit, which I expected to last long enough. Utilising local providers is also appealing.
However, their API is whitelisted, so I can&rsquo;t easily call it from a github actions pipeline. Not to mention my home IP uses CGNAT, and paying for a static IP defeats the purpose.
Github pages is free, so thats where I&rsquo;ll be hosting this. I&rsquo;ll also use github actions to do the deploying.</p>
<p><strong>Stay a while and listen.</strong></p>
